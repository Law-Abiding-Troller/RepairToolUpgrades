# RepairToolUpgrades
My Repair Tool Upgrades Subnautica Mod. Find the upgrades in the Fabricator! The tab for the repair tool and the upgrades should be under tools.

## Dependences

 - Subnautica
 - BepInEx
 - Nautilus

## Works better with, but not neccisary

 - Radial Tabs. Highly recommended to download this because other tabs will layer on top of the crafts.

## How to install:

1. Ensure you have BepInEx and Nautilus installed. If you do not, the mod will not work
2. Find the released that should be listed under the About section on the left side of this repository.
3. Click on the release, and download the ZIP file that is NOT labeled Source Code
4. Find BepInEx's plugins folder. This can be done before or after step 5.
5. Unzip (Extract) the downloaded ZIP folder into the folder you just found

## Known Bugs:

 - You cannot insert anything into the storage container. Currently fixing, will release with v0.1.1 later tonight
 - The Repair Tool is not removed from tools. Its a Nautilus bug. Will be fixed when Nautilus updates to 1.0.0.pre-36
