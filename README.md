# RepairToolUpgrades
My Repair Tool Upgrades Subnautica Mod. Find the upgrades in the Fabricator! The tab for the repair tool and the upgrades should be under tools.

## Dependences

 - Subnautica
 - BepInEx
 - Nautilus

## Works better with, but not neccisary

 - Radial Tabs. Highly recommended to download this because other tabs will layer on top of the crafts.

## How to install:

1. Ensure you have BepInEx and Nautilus installed. If you do not, the mod will not work
2. Find the released that should be listed under the About section on the left side of this repository.
3. Click on the release, and download the ZIP file that is NOT labeled Source Code
4. Find BepInEx's plugins folder. This can be done before or after step 5.
5. Unzip (Extract) the downloaded ZIP folder into the folder you just found

## Known Bugs:

None! I dare you to break the current version without decompiling it!

## Update News:
Rewriting the full mod at the moment. It isn't that buggy if I recall correctly. The next update to this mod should release in August along with Literal Seaglide Upgrades. However, it may release sooner depending on how much I get done
