# RepairToolUpgrades
My Repair Tool Upgrades Subnautica Mod. Find the upgrades in the Fabricator! The tab for the repair tool and the upgrades should be under tools.

## Dependences

 - Subnautica
 - BepInEx
 - Nautilus
 - UpgradesLIB

## Works better with, but not neccisary

 - Radial Tabs. Highly recommended to download this because other tabs will layer on top of the crafts.

## How to install:
1. Ensure you have the dependencies installed, if you do not, the mod will not work.
2. Find the right of this repository. There should be sections labeled `About`, `Releases`, `Packages`, and `Languages`. Find `Releases`, just under the about section.
3. Click on the latest release.
4. Download the ZIP file.
5. If you have Vortex, follow the Vortex Installation just after number 7.
6. If you have Subnautica Mod Manager, skip the Vortex Installation and go to Subnautica Mod Manager Installation (Not QModManager).
7. If you have neither, skip both the Vortex Installation and the Subnautica Mod Manager Installation and go straight to Manual Installation.

## Known Bugs:

None! I dare you to break the current version without decompiling it!

## Update News:
Rewriting the full mod at the moment. It isn't that buggy if I recall correctly. The next update to this mod should release in August along with Literal Seaglide Upgrades. However, it may release sooner depending on how much I get done
